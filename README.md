Overview of the Project

Project: LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


Objective:
      The objective of this project is to design and implement a database-driven system to 
efficiently manage a library's book inventory, members, and borrowing/return transactions. 
The system ensures proper record-keeping and provides an easy-to-use interface for 
managing library operations.


Key Activities
    1. Database Design:
            o Design tables for books, members, and transactions with appropriate relationships.
    2. Data Manipulation:
            o Perform basic SQL operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT to manage the library's data.
    3. Record Maintenance:
            o Track book inventory levels and ensure accurate borrowing and return transactions.
    4. Queries and Reports:
            o Write SQL queries to retrieve meaningful information, such as available books, member details, and transaction history.
    5. Error Handling:
            o Ensure database integrity and prevent inconsistencies during data manipulation.


Technologies Used:

   • Database Management System: MySQL
   • SQL Queries: For data insertion, updating, deletion, and retrieval
   • Triggers and Constraints: To maintain data integrity and automate specific processes
   • Programming Languages: Optional (e.g., Python, Java) for frontend or automation integration
   • Development Environment: MySQL Workbench
